# Git History

> Travel through git history of any repo.

Is currently used as test case to learn how [isomorphic-git](https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git) works. To extend it to add [sparse checkout](https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git/issues/1735) option.

All credit to [Inlang](https://github.com/inlang/inlang) as it uses its code in this app.

In future, this app should allow going back in history of any repo and easily seeing diffs of each commit. Maybe even spin up or run the code in a shell for any commit, in the browser.

## Run

```
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```
