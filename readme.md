# Git History

> Travel through git history, see diffs.

Idea is to be able to traverse through any Git history nicely in one signal page web app. [Press on commits in history, see the diffs, maybe even run the code with whatever files exist on that commit](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/status/1636518334035361805).

It's also used as a way to test [Git TS SDK](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/git).
